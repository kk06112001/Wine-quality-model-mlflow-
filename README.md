This repository contains the code for predicting wine quality based on various physicochemical properties using a neural network model. Hyperparameter optimization is performed using Hyperopt, while MLflow is used for tracking experiments and managing the model lifecycle. The model is trained using a white wine dataset, and key hyperparameters such as learning rate and momentum are tuned to minimize the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). The final model is logged and ready for deployment, including the validation of serving inputs for deployment.
